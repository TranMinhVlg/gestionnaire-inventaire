_________________________________________

I wanted to thank my web development professor, Bruno Simon for introducing me the basics of PHP, which allowed me to realize this project today.

***** WHAT WERE MY INSPIRATIONS ? ******

    - dribbble.com
    - codepen.io

***** WHAT ARE THE FEATURES ? *****

    DATABASE : 

    - Create a form to enter data into my database by the button submit.
    - Does not allow you to create two forms.
    - Cancel the form by the button cancel.
    - Transition on a field of the form when it is selected.
    - Delete a line of my table into my database by the button delete.
    - Display an error message when a validated form is empty

***** WHAT ARE INSTALLATIONS ? *****

    - jQuery library and a mp3 file have been installed.

***** WHAT WERE MY DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED ? *****

    - I took a little time to adapt to the new things we learned in class. My main difficulty was to bring up day and night to hover rocket, unfortunately I have been using jQuery to achieve it. However I still realize the idea I had in mind.

***** WHAT WOULD BE THE FUTURE FEATURES ? *****

    - Bring up the stars in the night
    - Achieve a rocket more realistic 
    - Make a joyful environment around rocket

***** WHAT I HAVE LEARNED DURING THIS PROJECT *****

    - I am more comfortable with the syntax animations and   transitions.
    - I learned to write correctly keyframes
    - I make the difference between animation and             transition
    - I understook how to use cubic bezier
